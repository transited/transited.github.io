    <p>In 2019, I got to work with the fine folks at Auckland Transport on the expected fleet impacts from the 2025 opening of the City Rail Link (CRL). The current <a href="https://at.govt.nz/bus-train-ferry/train-services/auckland-train-network/" target="_blank" title="AT Strip Map">strip map</a> can't easily be modified to include the CRL tunnel section, and the most prominent public-facing documents at this early stage weren't clear about the exact route structure. So I started from scratch and made a diagram that I could easily tweak to help walk through alternatives in our report. These are not necessarily the route combinations I would suggest--I might split the the eastern line intro cross-regional services instead of doubling back on itself, even if that means Grafton sees minimal service, but they had good reason to use this network shape instead.</p>
    <p><b>Notes on Design:</b> Auckland's isthmus geography is very identifiable, but because the focus was on conveying routing choices more than wayfinding I wanted to keep it simple; hence no legend or geographical cues. The font is open sans.</p>
