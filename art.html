  <h1>Art</h1>
  <p>I am not a trained artist or designer in any way. But art is fun! And having learned Inkscape to make passable maps, why not make other stuff? Here's a smattering of what I've put together. (In reverse chronological order so you can judge my growth or lack thereof.)</p>
  <h2>Termini</h2>
  <p>I'm not completely sure where the inspiration for this came from. I think it was a combination of (1) seeing all sorts of cool enamel pin designs out there and wanting to channel that minimalist, thick-lined style; (2) moving to Melbourne and being taken with Flinders Street Station, which is such a departure from the concrete columned neo-classical boxes often named Union Station in the US; and (3) discovering the mini-terminals/termini pun and running with it. At any rate, I ended up sketching out 20 different stations I've visited (plus Prague by request) before calling it a collection. I might still add more in the future&mdash;I'm open to requests.</p>

  <h2>War on Cars Insignia</h2>
  <p>If we're gonna fight this <a href="https://thewaroncars.org/" title="War on Cars podcast site">War on Cars</a>, maybe we need some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinctive_unit_insignia" title="Distinctive Unit Insignia on Wikipedia">Distinctive Unit Insignia</a>? (Probably should organize ourselves into actual units first, but that's but a detail.)</p>

  <h2>Baseball Outcomes</h2>
  <p>During the Cubs' 2016 World Series run, I needed something to keep my mind distracted on the nights they didn't play. I couldn't get baseball entirely out of my mind though, so (using data from <a href="http://www.retrosheet.org" title="Retrosheet website">retrosheet.org</a>) I made two Sankey Diagrams: one for every at-bat in the 2015 Regular Season (2016 data not being available at the time), and one for every World Series.</p>
