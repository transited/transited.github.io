	<h1>Art</h1>
	<p>I am not a trained artist or designer in any way. But art is fun, and I've found myself responsible for creating logos or other artwork for various groups/events that I've been involved with. These are what I came up with. They're in reverse chronological order, I'll leave it open to interpretation whether or not I've improved over the years.</p>
  <p>I made a flag for myself in 2019, because why not?</p>
