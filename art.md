	# Art
	I am not a trained artist or designer in any way. But art is fun, and I've found myself responsible for creating logos or other artwork for various groups/events that I've been involved with. These are what I came up with. They're in reverse chronological order, I'll leave it open to interpretation whether or not I've improved over the years.</p>
I made a flag for myself in 2019, because why not?
