	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I'm a transit consultant, focusing mostly on passenger rail of all types, but <a href="http://www.sjsu.edu/people/saul.cohn/courses/city/s0/27681191Wirth.pdf">urbanism is a way of life</a>. I've called 5 of the United States' 20 largest regions home for varying lengths of time: Chicago, Phildadelphia, DC, San Diego, and the Bay Area, though now I'm an expat in Melbourne, Australia. (Melbourne would currently slot in at #10 in the US.)
I currently work for LTK Australia, but I'm interested in (and fortunately have been involved in) projects throughout the US and Australia.</p>
