    <p>When I started working on the Cotton Belt project in 2017, there were only a few concept maps that focused exclusively on the corridor; they didn't show the new line's context within the larger network with three different agencies spanning a few hundred square miles. I originally made a little sketch by hand to get my bearings, then came back after the project was complete and formalized it digitally. 2022 has come and gone and the Cotton Belt has since been christened the Silver Line and is now projected to open in 2024.</p>
    <p><b>Notes on Design:</b> At the time I made this, there was no unified DART-DCTA-TRE rail map. And while the green-threaded-yellow DCTA A-line looks nice, I think the threading on both TEXRail and TRE makes for a jumble in downtown Ft Worth. All labels are Gill Sans, while the logo is based on Aharoni.</p>
