	<h1>CV</h1>
	<p>Since starting to work for LTK in 2012, I've been involved with several different clients. When my work resulted directly in a paper or other output, I've linked to it below. Other projects are ongoing or only produced internal working documents, so I've linked to the general public page. For a full accounting of my role with each of these projects, my resume and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedrosenbaum/">LinkedIn</a> have the details.</p>
  <h2>Publications</h2>
  <p> In addition to the original research below, I've also presented a status update on North American Light Rail & Streetcars at the 13th and 14th National Light Rail Conferences. (2015 in Minneapolis and 2019 in Jersey City, respectively)
  Towards a Passenger-Focused On-Time Performance Metric for Commuter Rail
Paper and Presentation, APTA Rail Conference 2018
This is a paper in 2 parts: (1) tracing the history of the nearly ubiquitous definition of on-time trains being "within 5 minutes of the schedule at the terminal" back to its origins in the steam railroad era of the early 1900s, and (2) a case study using Caltrain comparing the traditional metric with the actual passenger experience during 2016-17.
