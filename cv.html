	<h1>CV</h1>
	<p>For a full accounting of the various roles I've played with a whole mix of clients and projects, my resume and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedrosenbaum/">LinkedIn</a> have the details.</p>
  <h2>Publications</h2>
  <p>In addition to the original research below, I've also presented a status update on North American Light Rail & Streetcars at the last two National Light Rail Conferences:</p>

	<h3>Towards a Passenger-Focused On-Time Performance Metric for Commuter Rail</h3>
	<p> <em><a href="Files/TR APTA CR OTP FINAL 20180523.pdf">Paper</a> and Presentation, APTA Rail Conference 2018</em></p>
	<p>This is a paper in 2 parts: (1) tracing the history of the nearly ubiquitous definition of on-time trains being "within 5 minutes of the schedule at the terminal" back to its origins in the steam railroad era of the early 1900s, and (2) a case study using Caltrain comparing the traditional metric with the actual passenger experience during 2016-17.</p>

	<h3>Using Open Data and GIS to Rank Potential Commuter Rail Infill Station Sites</h3>
	<p><em><a href="Files/CR Infill-GIS TRBAM Poster 2013.pdf">Poster</a> Presentation, TRB Annual Meeting 2013</em></p>
	<p>What started out as a grad school project turned into a TRB Poster, presented at the annual meeting in January 2013. The session was focused on Open Data generally, so the results of the analysis were secondary to the collection and usage of the data. This is just as well, as not all of the methodology leading to the recommendation would pass muster; we scored smaller nearby populations higher because of the lower likelihood of a station inciting NIMBY protests, for instance.</p>
