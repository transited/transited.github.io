  <h1>Maps</h1>
  <div class="clearfix">
    <h2>Colorado (Bustang)</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="Files/BustangMap.png"><img class="right" src="Files/BustangMap.png" alt="Colorado Bustang Service Diagram" width="425" height="245"></a>
      After getting a handle on (Downtown) Denver, I wanted to see if there was a way to get out and explore the rest of the state without driving. CDOT runs the (successful and growing) Bustang service, but it only has an interactive <a href="https://ridebustang.com/routes-maps/" target="_blank title="Bustang Map">google map</a>. The state puts its typographical style online, so I tried my best to incorporate it, and the state's square geography adapts to a diagram pretty easily.</p>
  <div class="clearfix">
    <h2>Denver (RTD)</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="Files/RTD.Downtown0.3.png"><img class="right" src="Files/RTD.Downtown0.3.png" alt="Denver downtown bus map" width="425" height="230"></a>
      As I moved to Denver I tried to figure out where to live, and that meant getting to know RTD's network. The train system has a serviceable map, but there is no static bus network map. You can find individual routes or a dynamic map viewer, but the latter is near useless in the downtown area where lines turn in every direction. As much an exercise to get to know the system, I put together this downtown bus map. For clarity I organized the routes by whether they stop at X, Y, or Z stops along 15th and 17th Streets. This map has some strange-seeming gaps because I designed it to <a target="_blank" href="Files/DenverBus.Downtown0.3%20unsuspended.pdf">nicely include</a> the MetroRide and Light Rail lines that are suspended during the pandemic.</p>
  <div class="clearfix">
    <h2>Auckland (AT)</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="Files/AT2025full.png"><img class="right" src="Files/AT2025full.png" alt="Future Auckland train diagram" width="425" height="529"></a>
      In 2019, I got to work with the fine folks at Auckland Transport on the expected fleet impacts from the 2024 opening of the City Rail Link. The current <a href="https://at.govt.nz/bus-train-ferry/train-services/auckland-train-network/" target="_blank" title="AT Strip Map">strip map</a> can't easily be modified to include the CRL tunnel section, and the most prominent public-facing documents at this early stage aren't clear about the exact route structure. So I started from scratch and made a diagram that's I could also vary to help walk through alternatives in our report. I wanted to keep it simple (hence no legend or geographical cues to Auckland's locaiton on an isthmus) while maintaining useful details like which lines are peak-only, operate in only one direction, etc.</p>
  <div class="clearfix">
    <h2>San Diego (MTS)</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="Files/SDFlow.air.png"><img class="right" src="Files/SD.sm.png" alt="San Diego Trolley Diagram" width="425" height="529"></a>
    When I lived in San Diego, I was not yet enlightened. Despite living in Gaslamp and working at SWRMC (next to the Pacific Fleet stop), I drove to work every day&mdash;Uncle Sam was willing to give me a car to use seven days a week and free parking right outside my office, but only a transit pass for commuting ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. The <a href="https://www.sdmts.com/schedules-real-time-maps-and-routes/trolley" target="_blank" title="SD MTS trolley diagram">existing MTS map</a> features lots of awkward angles and no geographical context, and with the Mid-Coast Trolley extension opening soon(ish) they're going to need a new map anyway. I tried to move away from the current angular setup in favor of more languid curves, and added in a simplified coastline.</p>

    <h2>San Jose (VTA)</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="Files/VTA.2019.png"><img class="right" src="Files/VTA.2019.png" alt="VTA Light Rail Diagram" width="425" height="550"></a>While working on potential operating plans for the new east-west Tasman line, I needed some graphics to show various potential stopping patterns. Rather than try to re-shape the current map to show service along Tasman, I ended up building my own from scratch, and then expanding it to include the entire system. If given free reign I'd probably make more changes, but I needed to keep things as similar as possible to the existing diagram.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Metra</h2>
  <p> In my dreams, Metra is a world-class regional rail operator. The reality is less thrilling. The current map is frankly disappointing, and I wanted to do something about it. <a href="https://remapmetra.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" title="Remap Metra website">Remap Metra</a> was my attempt--click through for the whole thing and a write-up of my process. There are lots of faults with it (irregular angles, geographies that need to be compressed), and I'd like to do a v2.0 at some point. In the meantime, I think <a href="http://transitmap.net/post/175150068570/metra-rahul-raju">this</a> version gets at a lot of what I had in my mind.</p>
  <div class="clearfix">
    <h2>Metroplex Rail</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="Files/Metroplex Rail.2.png"><img class="right" src="Files/Metroplex Rail.2.png" alt="Dallas-Fort Worth Train Network Diagram" width="425" height="293"></a>When I started my work on the DART Cotton Belt Line, I needed to familiarize myself with Dallas transit. Neither the DART Light Rail <a href="https://www.dart.org/maps/printrailmap.asp" target="_blank" title="DART Light Rail diagram">diagram</a> nor the Cotton Belt-specific maps didn't show the connections to the rest of the Metroplex. So I sketched this out and stuck it in my notebook for reference.</p>

  <div class="clearfix">
    <h2>New Orleans (NORTA)</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="Files/NORTAmap.allstops2.png"><img class="right" src="Files/NORTA.sm.png" alt="New Orleans Streetcar Diagram" width="607" height="528"></a>Confession: I've never been to New Orleans. But in doing some research for the 2019 LRT Conference, I saw that NORTA's streetcar maps were either out of date (still showing the Rampart-St Claude line as UPT-Loyola) or were separated into pieces (i.e. a separate line diagram for the St. Charles Line from the rest of the system). So I made a new one.</p>
