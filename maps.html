  <h1>Maps</h1>
  <h2>San Jose (VTA)</h2>
  <p> While working on potential operating plans for a new east-west express line, I needed some graphics to show various potential stopping patterns. Rather than try to re-shape the current map to show service along Tasman, I ended up building my own from scratch, and then expanding it to include the entire system.</p>

  <h2>Metra</h2>
  <p> In my dreams, Metra is a world-class regional rail operator. The reality is less thrilling. The current map is frankly disappointing, and I wanted to do something about it. Remap Metra was my attempt--click through for the whole thing and a write-up of my process. There are lots of faults with it (irregular angles, geographies that need to be compressed), and I'd like to do a v2.0 at some point. In the meantime, I think <a href="http://transitmap.net/post/175150068570/metra-rahul-raju">this</a> version gets at a lot of what I had in my mind.</p>
  <h2>Metroplex Rail</h2>
  <p>When I started my work on the DART Cotton Belt Line, I needed to familiarize myself with Dallas transit. The DART Light Rail <a href="https://www.dart.org/maps/printrailmap.asp">map</a> leaves something to be desired in my mind, and the Cotton-Belt-specific maps didn't show the connections to the rest of the Metroplex. So I sketched this out and stuck it in my notebook for reference.

  <h2>New Orleans (NORTA)</h2>
  <p>Confession: I've never been to New Orleans. But in doing some research for the 2019 LRT Conference, I realized NORTA's streetcar maps were either out of date (still showing the Rampart-St Claude line as UPT-Loyola) or come in pieces (a separate line diagram for the St. Charles Line from the rest of the system). So I made a new one. </p>
