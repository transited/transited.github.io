      As I moved to Denver I tried to figure out where to live, and that meant getting to know RTD's network. The train system has a serviceable map, but there is no static bus network map. You can find individual routes or a dynamic map viewer, but the latter is near useless in the downtown area where lines turn in every direction. As much an exercise to get to know the system, I put together this downtown bus map. For clarity I organized the routes by whether they stop at X, Y, or Z stops along 15th and 17th Streets. This map has some strange-seeming gaps because I designed it to <a target="_blank" href="Files/DenverBus.Downtown0.3%20unsuspended.pdf">nicely include</a> the MetroRide and Light Rail lines that are suspended during the pandemic.</p>
