    <h2>Auckland (AT)</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="Files/AT2025full.png"><img class="right" src="Files/AT2025full.png" alt="Future Auckland train diagram" width="425" height="529"></a>
      In 2019, I got to work with the fine folks at Auckland Transport on the expected fleet impacts from the 2024 opening of the City Rail Link. The current <a href="https://at.govt.nz/bus-train-ferry/train-services/auckland-train-network/" title="AT Strip Map">strip map</a> can't easily be modified to include the CRL tunnel section, and the most prominent public-facing documents at this early stage aren't clear about the exact route structure. So I started from scratch and made a diagram that's I could also vary to help walk through alternatives in our report. I wanted to keep it simple (hence no legend or geographical cues to Auckland's locaiton on an isthmus) while maintaining useful details like which lines are peak-only, operate in only one direction, etc.

    <h2>San Diego (MTS)</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="Files/SDFlow.air.png"><img class="right" src="Files/SDFlow.air.png" alt="San Diego Trolley Diagram" width="425" height="529"></a>
    When I lived in San Diego, I was not yet enlightened. Despite living in Gaslamp and working at SWRMC (next to the Pacific Fleet stop), I drove to work every day&mdash;Uncle Sam was willing to give me a car to use seven days a week and free parking right outside my office, but only a transit pass for commuting ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. The <a href="https://www.sdmts.com/schedules-real-time-maps-and-routes/trolley" title="SD MTS trolley diagram">existing MTS map</a> features lots of awkward angles and no geographical context, and with the Mid-Coast Trolley extension opening soon(ish) they're going to need a new map anyway. I tried to move away from the current angular setup in favor of more languid curves, and added in a simplified coastline.</p>

    <h2>San Jose (VTA)</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="Files/VTA.2019.png"><img class="right" src="Files/VTA.2019.png" alt="VTA Light Rail Diagram" width="425" height="550"></a>While working on potential operating plans for the new east-west Tasman line, I needed some graphics to show various potential stopping patterns. Rather than try to re-shape the current map to show service along Tasman, I ended up building my own from scratch, and then expanding it to include the entire system. If given free reign I'd probably make more changes, but I needed to keep things as similar as possible to the existing diagram.</p>

  <h2>Metra</h2>
  <p> In my dreams, Metra is a world-class regional rail operator. The reality is less thrilling. The current map is frankly disappointing, and I wanted to do something about it. <a href="https://remapmetra.wordpress.com/" title="Remap Metra website">Remap Metra</a> was my attempt--click through for the whole thing and a write-up of my process. There are lots of faults with it (irregular angles, geographies that need to be compressed), and I'd like to do a v2.0 at some point. In the meantime, I think <a href="http://transitmap.net/post/175150068570/metra-rahul-raju">this</a> version gets at a lot of what I had in my mind.</p>
  <div class="clearfix">
    <h2>Metroplex Rail</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="Files/Metroplex Rail.2.png"><img class="right" src="Files/Metroplex Rail.2.png" alt="Dallas-Fort Worth Train Network Diagram" width="425" height="293"></a>When I started my work on the DART Cotton Belt Line, I needed to familiarize myself with Dallas transit. Neither the DART Light Rail <a href="https://www.dart.org/maps/printrailmap.asp" title="DART Light Rail diagram">diagram</a> nor the Cotton Belt-specific maps didn't show the connections to the rest of the Metroplex. So I sketched this out and stuck it in my notebook for reference.</p>

  <div class="clearfix">
    <h2>New Orleans (NORTA)</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="Files/NORTAmap.allstops2.png"><img class="right" src="Files/NORTAmap.allstops2.png" alt="New Orleans Streetcar Diagram" width="607" height="528"></a>Confession: I've never been to New Orleans. But in doing some research for the 2019 LRT Conference, I saw that NORTA's streetcar maps were either out of date (still showing the Rampart-St Claude line as UPT-Loyola) or were separated into pieces (i.e. a separate line diagram for the St. Charles Line from the rest of the system). So I made a new one.</p>
