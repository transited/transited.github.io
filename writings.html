  <h1>Writings</h1>
  <p>A lot of my job results in memos and reports of varying lengths, but there's always time to write about other (still urban-ish) stuff. A small collection:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/ElginRdCivicCenter.html">Evanston Elgin Road Civic Center Proposal</a> (April 2019)</li>
    <li>In 2016, I was asked for my thoughts on this <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2016/01/22/driverless-cars-and-future-getting-around-415405.html">Newsweek</a> cover article. The question posed to me was basically: "shouldn't you go work for Google or Uber or something to avoid obsolescence when self-driving cars arrive?" <a href="/transit-will-not-die">This was my response</a>.</li>
    <li>We got a puppy in 2021. In January 2022, our dog trainer asked us to go on her podcast to talk about our experience. <a href="https://www.familypupz.com/podcast">FamilyPupz Podcast</a>
