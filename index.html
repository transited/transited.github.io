	<h1>Ted Rosenbaum</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my digital anchorage. After stints in six different major metro areas (Chicagoland, Philadelphia, DC, San Diego, the Bay Area, and Melbourne, Australia), I've landed (hopefully for a long time) in Denver.</p>
	<p>I'm fascinated by cities and I'm fortunate to be a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20569994" title="Sandburg Chicago poem" target="_blank">player with railroads</a> and get paid for it. I firmly believe that inertia is the cause of&mdash;and solution to&mdash;all of life's problems<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. And that although we should run transit as fast as necessary but no faster, it should definitely be more frequent.</p>
