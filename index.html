	<h1>Ted Rosenbaum</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my digital anchorage, a counter to my meandering meatspace existence. I've recently returned from a stint in Melbourne where I got intimately familiar with the world's largest tram system, but snuck in time to get to know Auckland (and a few roos) too. I've landed (hopefully for long time) in Denver, marking the sixth different major US metro area I've called home, having lived in/around Chicago, Phildadelphia, DC, San Diego, and the Bay Area for varying lengths of time.</p>
	<p>I'm fascinated by cities and I'm fortunate to be a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20569994" title="Sandburg Chicago poem" target="_blank">player with railroads</a> and get paid for it. I firmly believe that inertia is the cause of&mdash;and solution to all of life's problems<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. And that although we should run transit as fast as necessary but no faster, it should definitely be more frequent.</p>
