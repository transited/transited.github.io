    <p>In 2022-23 I got to know the folks at Greater Denver Transit. Among other things, they're <a href="https://www.greaterdenvertransit.com/frontrangepassengerrail/rtdheavyrailupgrade/" target="_blank" title="GDT RTD Upgrade Proposal">advocating for Front Range Rail to share tracks with RTD</a> by converting southwest light rail (the pre-covid C line) to 25kV AC and allowing for through running with the Golden (G) and nascent Boulder (B) lines, avoiding Denver Union Station's stub-end. Along with some operations sanity checks, I put a few maps together for them, including this diagram focused on the resulting RTD network.</p>
    <p><b>Notes on Design:</b> I tried to stick with RTD's color scheme as much as possible. I kept the B line's green, used the C line's orange for the route to Golden, and the L line's yellow for the new WL line from Jeffco through Five Points. The resulting blue/red/orange/green/FRPR section south of downtown really pops compared to the existing map's blue/purple/green. The bold, filled-in station bubbles with the FRPR logo help keep the focus on the new service. All labels are in Franklin Gothic, which is narrow enough to keep this readable on a letter-sized piece of paper.</p>
