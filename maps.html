    <h2>Colorado (Bustang)</h2>

      After getting a handle on (Downtown) Denver, I wanted to see if there was a way to get out and explore the rest of the state without driving. CDOT runs the Bustang and Outrider services, but there's only an interactive <a href="https://ridebustang.com/routes-maps/" target="_blank title="Bustang Map">google map</a> showing the full network. The state puts its typographical style online, so I tried my best to incorporate it, and Colorado's square geography adapts to a diagram pretty easily. This map was current as of about April 2021, but is out of date now that additional services have been added.</p>

    <h2>Denver (RTD)</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="Files/RTD.Downtown0.3.png"><img class="right" src="Files/RTD.Downtown0.3.png" alt="Denver downtown bus map" width="425" height="230"></a>
      As I moved to Denver I tried to figure out where to live, and that meant getting to know RTD's network. The train system has a serviceable map, but there is no static bus network map. You can find individual routes or a dynamic map viewer, but the latter is near useless in the downtown area where lines turn in every direction. As much an exercise to get to know the system, I put together this downtown bus map. For clarity I organized the routes by whether they stop at X, Y, or Z stops along 15th and 17th Streets. This map has some strange-seeming gaps because I designed it to <a target="_blank" href="Files/DenverBus.Downtown0.3%20unsuspended.pdf">nicely include</a> the MetroRide and Light Rail lines that are suspended during the pandemic.</p>
