	<h1>Ted Rosenbaum</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my digital anchorage, a counter to my meandering meatspace existence. Currently I'm an expat in Melbourne, where the Moon is upside down the Cubs play in the middle of the night. Before that, I called 5 of the United States' 20 largest regions<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> home for varying lengths of time: Chicago, Phildadelphia, DC, San Diego, and the Bay Area. </p>
	<p>I'm fascinated by cities and I'm fortunate to be a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20569994" title="Sandburg Chicago poem" target="_blank">player with trains</a> and get paid for it. I firmly believe that inertia is the cause of&mdash;and solution to all of life's problems<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. And that although we should run trains as fast as possible but no faster, they should definitely be more frequent.</p>
